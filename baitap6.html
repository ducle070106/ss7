      <p>
        <span class="text-black">This is the second item's accordion body</span
        >. It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the
        appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes
        control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via
        CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or
        overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about
        any HTML can go within the
        <span class="text-pink">.accordion-body</span>, though the transition
        does limit overflow.
